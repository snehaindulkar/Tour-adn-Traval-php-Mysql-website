      Abstract—Blockchain,  the  foundation  of  Bitcoin,  has  receivedextensive attentions recently. Blockchain serves as an immutableledger  which  allows  transactions  take  place  in  a  decentralizedmanner.  Blockchain-based  applications  are  springing  up,  cov-ering  numerous  fields  including  financial  services,  reputationsystem   and   Internet   of   Things   (IoT),   and   so   on.   However,there  are  still  many  challenges  of  blockchain  technology  suchas  scalability  and  security  problems  waiting  to  be  overcome.This  paper  presents  a  comprehensive  overview  on  blockchaintechnology. We provide an overview of blockchain architechturefirstly  and  compare  some  typical  consensus  algorithms  usedin  different  blockchains.  Furthermore,  technical  challenges  andrecent advances are briefly listed. We also lay out possible futuretrends  for  blockchain.Index  Terms—Blockchain,  decentralization,  consensus,  scala-bilityI. INTRODUCTIONNowadayscryptocurrencyhas become a buzzword in bothindustry and academia. As one of the most successful cryp-tocurrency, Bitcoin has enjoyed a huge success with its capitalmarket reaching 10 billion dollars in 2016 [1]. With a spe-cially designed data storage structure, transactions in Bitcoinnetwork could happen without any third party and the coretechnology
	  to build Bitcoin isblockchain, which was firstproposed in 2008 and implemented in 2009 [2]. Blockchaincould be
	  regarded as a public ledger and all committedtransactions are stored in a list of blocks.

	  This chain growsas new blocks are appended to it continuously. Asymmetriccryptography and distributed consensus algorithms
	  have beenimplemented for user security and ledger consistency. Theblockchain technology generally has key characteristics 
	  ofdecentralization, persistency, anonymity and auditability. Withthese traits, blockchain can greatly save the cost and 
	  improvethe efficiency.Since it allows payment to be finished without any bank orany intermediary, blockchain can be used 
	  in various financialservices such as digital assets, remittance and online payment.
